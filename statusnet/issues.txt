Fixes / to-dos


Fixes
===========

Navigation: 
 - Tips links to a user's own tips, should show the list of all tips
 - Clicking the logo links to a user's own status messages, should show the public timeline
 - Tips screen should have 2nd menu for tips
 - Me page should have the graph in the main area, not the status area
 - Page labels should not be showing up 
 - main navigation labels are incorrect. they should read "Add steps // Share a tip // Say something"

Tips:
 - Marking a tip to-do or have-done is broken
 - the /alltips timeline show's a user's tips should show everyone's tips
 
 Graph:
 - This should use the existing database connection, so we don't have to customize it for each install
 
 
To-do
===========

Me page
 - Show total points, available points, personal steps baseline

Settings
 - Add SMS settings page
 - Add SMS preference: Send daily reminder

Twilio
 - Send daily reminder at 8pm. "How many steps did you get today? -stephealth.org"
 - If user just sends 1 integer, 
 	after 8pm, mark it as today
 	before 8pm, mark it as yesterday
 - Otherwise, expect date [space] step number. prefer month-day but accept others. ignore ","
 	4-2 10000 => 10,000 steps on April 2nd
 	4-02
 	04-02
 	4-2-12
 	4-02-12
 	04-02-12
 	0402
 	040212
 - After processing, reply to user:
 	success: "Got it. 10,000 steps on 4/2/12. visit stephealth.org to see how your friends are doing!"
 	failure: "Whoops! Try it this way: If you took 10,000 steps on April 2nd, send '0402 10000' -stephealth.org"
